# Queue Event
## About the Project
This project aims to simulate a queue for reserving or purchasing tickets for an event. We can create an event, set the number of available tickets, name the event, and publish it. Additionally, a client can fill out a form to create a ticket. When all tickets are sold, every user will be notified that "There are no tickets available," and the queue list will be closed.
